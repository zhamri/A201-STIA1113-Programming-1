1. display the detail calculation.

## Example of the output
```
Money (RM): 150
----------------------------------------
12 set A (288 bottles) x RM12.0 = RM144.00
0 set B (0 bottles) x RM8.0 = RM0.00
6 bottle(s) x RM1.0 = RM6.00
Total Bottle(s): 294
Total Price: RM150.00
Balance: RM0.00
----------------------------------------

Quantity (bottles): 70
----------------------------------------
2 set A (48 bottles) x RM12.0 = RM24.00
2 set B (20 bottles) x RM8.0 = RM16.00
2 bottle(s) x RM1.0 = RM2.00
Total Price: RM42.00
